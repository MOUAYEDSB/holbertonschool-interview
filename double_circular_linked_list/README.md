## Double Circular Linked List ðŸ’»
# Description
This exercise involves implementing functions to manage a double circular linked list, a data structure where each node contains a string and pointers to both the previous and next nodes, forming a circular sequence. Specifically, the task requires creating two functions: one to add a new node at the end of the list and another to add a new node at the beginning. These functions must handle memory allocation and ensure the circular nature of the list is maintained.
