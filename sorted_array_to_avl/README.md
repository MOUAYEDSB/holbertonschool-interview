## Array to AVL
# Description ðŸ’¬
- "Array to AVL" refers to the process of converting a linear array into an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree, which is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. The goal of this transformation is to take the unstructured or linearly structured data from an array and organize it into an AVL tree. This ensures that operations like search, insertion, and deletion can be performed more efficiently, with time complexities of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree. The AVL tree maintains its balance using a set of rotation operations to ensure that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is no more than one, thus maintaining a balanced structure that optimizes the tree's height and ensures efficient data access patterns.
