## Linear search in skip list ðŸ’»
# Description: ðŸ’¬
- A skip list is a data structure that enhances efficient searching, insertion, and deletion in an ordered list, serving as an alternative to balanced search trees. A skip list consists of multiple levels of simple linked lists, with each level being a sublist of the one below. Linear search in a skip list, while still involving a step-by-step check of each element, is more efficient than in a simple linked list due to the ability to "skip" over blocks of elements that don't need checking. The search begins at the highest level, moving horizontally until an element greater than the target is encountered, then dropping to a lower level, and repeating this until the lowest level is reached where a classic linear search is conducted if necessary. This level-based traversal, coupled with the option to skip large sections, makes skip lists particularly useful for data collections that undergo frequent updates, maintaining robust search performance amidst multiple changes.
